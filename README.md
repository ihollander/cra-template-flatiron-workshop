# Flatiron Workshop Template

## Generating New Workshops

To create a new workshop from a template, run:

```sh
npx create-react-app workshop-name --use-npm --template @ihollander/cra-template-flatiron-workshop
```

This will create a new workshop repo with some starter code and all the
necessary dependencies. It also provides a README with student-facing
instructions for getting the workshop set up locally.

> NOTE: The script above uses npm instead of yarn as the default package
> installer. There are some dependency issues with yarn that need some further
> investigation; in the meantime, npm works just fine.
